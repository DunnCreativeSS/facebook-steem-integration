1. To extend this repository, one would apply and get approved for user_photos and user_posts reading on Facebook, then recreate the posts->likes structure that we'd created for Facebook Pages integrations for both a user's photos and their posts.4


2. We were denied this in our testing as an app that just posts to SteemIt doesn't meet their requirements.


3. What might be fun is taking a UI like SteemIt's UI (maybe) and build it as an overlay for Facebook->SteemIt interactions, then only display our Tags


4. If we do it with a UI, Facebook might approve our App and we can make it bigger, smarter, better!
